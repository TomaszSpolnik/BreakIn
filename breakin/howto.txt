Folder 'breakin' must be on pendrive's root directory.

While booting from windows installation pendrive press:

"shift + f10" or "fn + shift + f10" (opens CMD)

go into directory of the pendrive (type: "d:\", "e:\", "f:\", "g:\" etc. and "dir" to confirm that 'breakin' folder is present):

type:

"cd breakin" (breakin is the folder that contains scripts)

and type:

"s1.bat" (first script)

after restart into windows click on the wheelchair icon while on login screen which opens CMD and type:

"s2.bat"

after restart into windows log into Administrator account

Do whatever you have to do (just do not modify or open anything:))

click on the wheelchair icon while on login screen which opens CMD and type:

"s3.bat"

after restart while booting from windows installation pendrive press:

"shift + f10" or "fn + shift + f10" (opens CMD)

go into directory of the pendrive (type: "d:\", "e:\", "f:\", "g:\" etc. and "dir" to confirm that 'breakin' folder is present):

type:

"cd breakin" (breakin is the folder that contains scripts)

and type:

"s4.bat"

Now everything is reversed.

Have a good one,
